    Concept Questions:
* What is the difference of List, Set, Queue, and Maps?
* How do you iterate through a HashSet?
* How do you iterate through a HashMap?
* How would you remove elements from a Collection during iteration?
* What is FIFO and LIFO and how are they different?
* What is thread safe?



    1-) List, Set and Queue are the interface that implements from Collection interface. Maps is a different interface that has not have any
    relationship between List, Set and Queue interfaces. Main difference between List and Set is that List has a index number, and also can have
    duplicate elements, but Set does not allow to have any duplicate elements. On the other hand List has a insertion order, but Set does not have
    insertion order. Queue is another interface. Queue has FIFO ( first in first out ) , insertion order not preserved, and also allows duplicate

    5-) FIFO stands for first in first out. When we add new elements to, it is going to be last element that will be removed.
     LIFO stands for last in first out, when we add new elements, it is going to be first element that will be removed.
    6-) Thread safe means synchronized, it means two different action can not be done at the same time, first action has to finished, so second
    action can start. Like an atm.

    Q: What is the difference between overloading and overriding

    overloading is to change the number or type of parameters to allow another method with the same name and this happens in the same file

    overriding is changing the implementation of the method between a super and sub class, so the method in the sub classes works differently for the sub class objects



    final variable : variable that cannot be change, after ot has a value it cannot be reassigned

     ex: final int a = 5;
     a=10; // this will give problem

     Q: What are constants
        static final variable. Information that cannot be changed. Can be access anywhere by class name
        ex: Math.PI

        Note : convention for constant variables is to define the name in all uppercase

        final method: method that cannot  aver ridden, which means you can not change the implementation

        Q: Can you overload a final method
        yes, you create a method with the same name and different parameters

        final class: this class can not be the parent of another class
        Q: Can a final class be a child class
        yes, at least it will be the child of Object class

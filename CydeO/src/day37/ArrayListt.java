    ArrayList = It is a class. It is part of the collection framework

    data structures/ handle and work with the data

    ArrayList allows duplicate elements
    ArrayList is ordered --> order of the elements will be maintained

    Array vs ArrayList
    Array : data structure with a fix size
            can store both primitive types and objects type
            objects themselves do not have a methods
            --> there is an Arrays class, which is a utility class
     ArrayList :
            collection that is dynamic --> the size can be changed anytime, and automatically
            --> becomes bigger and smaller
            doesn't work with primitive data types
            --> we need to use wrapper classes

            The ArrayList objects have a methods

        // the class is in package : java.lang --> this one is very common that's why we do not need to import
//        Scanner class was in java.util

    // Strings are object type , not primitive data types
// immutable : can not change
// in java: an immutable object can not be changed after it made. the value can not be changed
//     there are two ways to create String object
//         1- by String literal
//         2- by new keyword
//         String pool -> special place for String;  stack where variable are , heap where objects are , special place in the heap.

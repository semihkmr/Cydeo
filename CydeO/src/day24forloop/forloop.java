    /* 1 - initialization : declare and assign a variable that is used in the loop. usually used to keep track of the number of iterations. other use of the variable can be done, for example using the number as an index of a String
     --> this runs once, in the beginning

     2) termination condition the boolean that determines if you should run/ continue the loop
       if the boolean is true : the statements in the loop will execute
       if the boolean is false the loop will stop
      3) the code in the loop body is executed - this is one iteration of the statements
      4) update : changes variable to avoid infinite loop
      5) going back up to step 2 - iteration is complete, next cycle will start
